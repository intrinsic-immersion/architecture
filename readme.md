## Past Project Retrospective


Hello, 

## [Digital Care](./digitcal-care-helpcenter-and-chat.md)

I wanted to walk through the Digital Care endeavor as it had a lot of challenges and many meaty parts, it was 5-4 
years ago, but, it's still fresh. I was a Manager at the time, so, not an IC, but, I go into more of this in that markdown here


---

[Feature Fabric](/feature-fabric.md)

I'm leaving this up as the original I was going to talk through; I pivoted from Feature Fabric to Digital Care given the larger surface area and that much time you start to second guess everything :D  This was also a blast to build, promote and see folks get excited about using.


### BONUS

[XBOX Purchase WebBlend](./xbox-one-weblend.md)

I worked on the XBOX ONE purchase flow and came up with the idea for web-blend given my expertise with dom tech. It allowed us to facilitate purchases on console and web using the same secure core purchase flow codebase. I also designed marketplace.xbox.com and parts of account.xbox.com while leading a china v-team to build them using web blend tech. My original thought was that's some very fun and meaty work to talk through. That said, it felt a bit too meaty given the moving parts and surface area to cover.
